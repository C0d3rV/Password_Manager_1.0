# üîê A Simple Password Manager

A simple desktop application for generating and saving passwords. This tool provides a basic interface to create strong, unique passwords and manage login credentials locally.

## Features

  * **Strong Password Generation:** Creates a secure, randomized password using a mix of letters, symbols, and numbers.
  * **Automatic Clipboard Copy:** The generated password is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy pasting.
  * **Local Credential Storage:** Saves the website, email/username, and password together in a local `saved_passwords.txt` file.
  * **Simple User Interface:** The interface is clean, intuitive, and built with Python's Tkinter library.
  * **Input Validation:** Checks to ensure all fields are filled before saving an entry.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
